* [Gender](https://doi.org/10.2908/DEMO_PJAN)
* [Education](https://doi.org/10.2908/EDAT_LFS_9903)
* [Disability](https://doi.org/10.2908/HLTH_SILC_12)
* [Migration background](https://doi.org/10.2908/MIGR_POP3CTB)

Note that the minimum age to stand as MEP is 18 in most member states. More details can be found [here](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/ATAG/2023/749766/EPRS_ATA(2023)749766_EN.pdf)
